This is a gathering of some +shitposts+ small uxntal programs I made.

For absolutely large files I may include a subdirectory like [[https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils][uxn-utils]] did.

** Current Shitposts

[X] hello-world.tal
basically just the basic hello world despite adding the comma and the exclamation mark

[X] b64enc.tal
Like its name implies, this does a base64 encoding, despite being similar to uxn-utils/cli/base64/b64enc.tal, this does not pad with \x00, and appends equal signs
